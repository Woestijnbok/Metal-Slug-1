# Introduction

Welcome to my remake of the first level of *Metal Slug 1*! This project was developed using a game engine provided by [Digital Arts & Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/) during my time there as a student. 
The goal was to capture the fun and challenge of the original *Metal Slug* side-scroller while adding my own twist to certain gameplay elements.

# Controls

In this remake, you can explore the level, face off against a variety of enemies, and use classic arcade-style mechanics to progress. 
The controls are designed to be intuitive and simple for quick, responsive gameplay.

- **Movement**: Use **WASD** keys for navigation.
- **Jumping**: Press **SPACE** to jump.
- **Shooting**: Use the **LEFT MOUSE BUTTON** to shoot.
- **Menu**: Use **ESC** to open the menu and **LEFT MOUSE BUTTON** to select menu options.

These controls are meant to keep the player moving, dodging, and firing just like in the original *Metal Slug* experience.

# Enemies

Though the remake does not include every detail from the original, it does feature a selection of enemies with varied behaviors:

1. **Rebel Soldier**: This enemy patrols the area and will flee with it sees a player.
2. **Rifle Rebel Soldier**: A more challenging variant, this soldier will shoot at you when you get too close.

# Final Boss

At the end of the level, you’ll encounter a formidable boss with two attack patterns:

- **Standard Attack**: The boss can fire three plasma balls, regardless of the gun's position (up or at the floor). These projectiles will reach the player if they don’t move, encouraging you to stay mobile.
- **Plasma Laser Attack**: This powerful attack is only available when the gun is aimed at the ground. When triggered, it fires a fast-paced laser that can deal significant damage. Stay airborne or move out of the line of fire to avoid it.

# Final Thoughts

This project was a challenging yet rewarding opportunity to start my game developing journey and reimagine an iconic level with my own spin.
I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed creating it!
